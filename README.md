The aim of the selector guide is searching every product which Via technologies (https://www.viatech.com/en/) develops. 
By some features that you put into the selector guide you can see some output, which are:
 - name of the product; 
 - all its features; 
 - datasheet of some products (only on excel);

*** 

The work has been done on three different platform, which are: 
- Visual Studio Community 2015 (c#) __ https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Selector-Guide/blob/main/SELECTOR%20GUIDE%20AND%20WEBSITE%20(project)/SELECTOR%20GUIDE%20(OFFICIAL)/Selector.exe;
